Here you can email Users or Groups across the Portal.  
By clicking on the "To" button, you gain access to an 
interactive list to pick who you wish to send the email to.  
You can also save your email as a template and re-use it at a 
later date.

<p>
Note that the editor is an HTML editor and that your emails will be sent as HTML content.
This means that any whitespace you type (i.e. new lines) will not appear in the email. 
If you would like a newline character to appear in the email, write your text between a &lt;p&gt; tag 
(you can create one using the paragraph icon on the editor toolbar) or use a &lt;br&gt; tag.

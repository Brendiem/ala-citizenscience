<h1>Embedded Widgets</h1>

<p>
	Here you can create widgets to add to this site or any other site. You can currently create two types of widgets:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>a 'Latest Statistics' widget that will report the number of users, records, and species in the system</li>
	<li>an 'Image Slideshow' widget that will show a slideshow of all the images in an image gallery</li>
</ul>
<p>
    To create a widget, go to the <a href="${portalContextPath}/bdrs/public/embedded/widgetBuilder.htm">Embedded Widgets</a> page.
</p>
<p>
    To create an image gallery to be used in an 'Image Slideshow' widget, go to the <a href="${portalContextPath}/bdrs/admin/gallery/listing.htm">Manage Galleries</a> page.

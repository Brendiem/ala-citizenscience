</ul>

<h4>Using your gallery:</h4>
<p>

Select the 'Image Slideshow' widget, select your gallery, and edit the display properties as required.

<h4>Tips on getting the most out of your gallery</h4>
<ul>
    <li>If you are using auto resizing, the images will look nicer if they are a 1.6:1 width-to-height ratio, or as close as possible to that ratio</li>
    <li>If you are cropping your images manually, make all the images the same dimensions. When creating your embedded widget, set the image width/height properties
    to the same dimensions as your uploaded image.  Also make sure to leave enough space in the widget width/height to display your captions. 
    You should add about 100px height to display the caption text.</li>
</ul>

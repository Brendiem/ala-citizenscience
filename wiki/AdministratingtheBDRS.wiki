= Setup =

== Default Passwords ==

After installing and starting up the system, two user accounts will be automatically created for you: "root" and "admin" with default password "password".  You will want to change these passwords before your system goes live.  To change the password, log in with the given credentials and go to Profile > My Profile.  From this page, you can enter a new password.

== Adding the Google Maps API Key ==

When setting up a new system or a new portal on the system, you must add a google maps API key or you will get an error on all pages with a map.  Set up the key preference using the following steps:

  # Get a Google Maps API key from http://code.google.com/apis/maps/signup.html.
  # Sign in to your BDRS instance/portal with an admin account.
  # Go to the Admin > Manage Portal > Edit Preferences menu.
  # Scroll down the page to the heading "API Keys"
  # Create the google maps API key according to the directions on the page.  For example, if your server is running on www.example.com, enter a description like "Google Map API key for www.example.com", a key of "google.map.key.example" and value of "www.example.com, {{{[key from google maps api page]}}}".

== Adding the Google Maps API Key ==

When setting up a new system or a new portal on the system, you must add a google maps API key or you will get an error on all pages with a map.  Set up the key preference using the following steps:

  # Get a Google Maps API key from http://code.google.com/apis/maps/signup.html.
  # Sign in to your BDRS instance/portal with an admin account.
  # Go to the Admin > Manage Portal > Edit Preferences menu.
  # Scroll down the page to the heading "API Keys"
  # Create the google maps API key according to the directions on the page.  For example, if your server is running on www.example.com, enter a description like "Google Map API key for www.example.com", a key of "google.map.key.example" and value of "www.example.com, {{{[key from google maps api page]}}}".

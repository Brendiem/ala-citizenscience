#summary Basic guide on how to setup MapServer and MapCache. Not BDRS specific.

= Installation steps for Linux (standard cgi script) =

1. Install MapServer using apt-get
{{{
sudo apt-get install cgi-mapserver mapserver-bin mapserver-doc php5-mapscript python-mapscript
}}}
The default install directory is */usr/lib/cgi-bin*.
Verify installation
{{{
/usr/lib/cgi-bin/mapserv -v
}}}
Verify apache can run the cgi script
{{{
http://localhost/cgi-bin/mapserv
}}}

2. Put your MapServer config file into your cgi-lib directory. By default it is in /usr/lib/cgi-bin. The mapserv executable cgi script should also be in this directory.
3. Not always required but google projection is a very common projection that isn't part of the standard epsg file. Add the google projection to your epsg file in /usr/share/proj/epsg
{{{
# Google projection
<900913> +proj=merc +a=6378137 +b=6378137 +lat_ts=0.0 +lon_0=0.0 +x_0=0.0 +y_0=0 +k=1.0 +units=m +nadgrids=@null +no_defs <>
}}}

4. Your MapServer should now be able to serve up layers defined in your config file.

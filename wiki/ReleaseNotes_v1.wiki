= BDRS 1.0 Release Notes =

Welcome to BDRS 1.0!


== Known Issues ==
Weâ€™ve done our best to make BDRS 1.0 as solid as possible, but unfortunately there are a couple of issues that we know about in the release.

=== Creating records with a hidden latitude and longitude ===
When creating or editing a record for a survey with hidden latitude and longitude fields, the map will still be displayed. You may click on the map and a point will appear but on submission no spatial data will be saved.

_Note that you will not be able to see your record on the map tab of the `MySightings` page because the record does not have a latitude and longitude._

This bug will be fixed in the next release of the BDRS.
